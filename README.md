# Decryption of Columnar Transposition Cipher 
This project is a secure computing project aimed at deciphering encrypted texts that have been encoded using the Columnar Transposition Cipher method. An algorithm has been developed that decrypts the text and identifies the encryption key employed. The decryption process relies on analyzing the frequency of repetition of binary combinations of letters, allowing for the reconstruction of the original message. 

This project was done in collaboration with @hehesam.
